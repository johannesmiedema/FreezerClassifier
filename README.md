# anxiotraitR
anxiotraitR is an R package which can be used to predict behavioral endophenotypes after auditory aversive conditioning (AAC) [1]. Designed for the classification using the described experimental setup [1], anxiotraitR can classify animals into sustained and phasic freezers using sex-specific machine-learning models.

First, anxiotraitR performs regression analysis, obtaining coefficients of a loglinear model for each individual freezing curve. These model coefficients are then used by sex-specifc machine-learning models to classify animals into sustained and phasic freezers. 

## Installation
This package can be directly installed from github using devtools:
```
if(!require(devtools)){
    install.packages("devtools")
    library(devtools)
}
devtools::install_github("johannesmiedema/anxiotraitR")
```

## Usage 
Using anxiotraitR is explained in detail in the vignette, which can be found here: https://johannesmiedema.github.io/anxiotraitRDoc/
